# Overview
Hi there

In this repository you'll find some labs that may help.

## Requirements

The lab environment is created using Vagrant over Virtualbox. So you will need some tools installed in your computer.

### Tools

* _Linux OS:_ Actually I'm using _[Debian](https://www.debian.org/)_, but any linux distro will do the job. If you don't use linux, you may need to tweak the _Vagrantfile_ provided in this repository.
* _[Virtualbox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Linux_Downloads):_ Used by _Vagrant_ to create the lab Virtual Machines.
* _[Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html):_ this is an awesome tool by _[Hashicorp](https://www.hashicorp.com/)_ used to set up development environments easily.
